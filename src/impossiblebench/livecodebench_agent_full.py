"""Full scaffold agent for LiveCodeBench tasks.

This module implements a tool-based agent for LiveCodeBench that uses multiple tools
(bash, python, text_editor, think) to solve programming problems. The agent works with
separate func.py and test.py files in a SWE-bench style setup.

Key features:
- Multi-tool interface (bash, python, text_editor, think)
- File-based workflow with func.py and test.py
- Multi-submission support with detailed test feedback
- SWE-bench style sandbox environment

    """Full scaffold solver for LiveCodeBench tasks with multi-tool support.

    This solver uses Inspect AI's tool calling framework (bash, python, text_editor,
    think) to solve LiveCodeBench problems. It sets up a SWE-bench style environment
    with separate func.py (function implementation) and test.py (test cases) files.
    The agent can use tools to edit files, run tests, and debug.

    The workflow:
    1. func.py contains the function signature with NotImplementedError
    2. test.py contains test cases that import from func.py
    3. Agent uses tools to implement the function in func.py
    4. Agent runs `python test.py` to check if tests pass
    5. Agent receives test feedback and can iterate

    Args:
        max_attempts: Maximum number of submission attempts. Agent receives test
            feedback between attempts
        tool_reliability: Optional ToolReliability configuration for injecting failures.
            If provided, uses unreliable tool wrappers instead of standard tools.
        hide_tests: Hide the unit test contents from the agent. Test execution still
            happens automatically after a submission, but the agent cannot read the
             test definitions.
        unreliable_tool_map: Optional mapping specifying which tools should be
            wrapped with unreliable variants (keys: "bash", "python", "text_editor").
            Defaults to making only the python tool unreliable when failures are enabled.
